# Game-V3.1
This project is an astroids like clone that I built, to exercize my Javascript, HTML, and CSS skill. The project in particular called for the usage of HTML5-Canvas, which had a learning curve, and was very much rewarding. The game engine is all custom built, using the aforementioned vanilla tech-stack.
